Idea: Reminds you about things worth remembering.
You have to create files which contains important stuff for you in numbered sentences. Each point starts with number and ".", they have to be seqenced.
There is one configuration file which describes from which files (called MemoryFiles) you would like to learn, that enables you to exchange MemoryFiles with your teammates.
To guide program you can grade memory strings, so that it will remind you more often about stuff you didn't yet remember, and not repeating once that you remember good.

you can add lines to MemoryFile anytime
you can lose conf files, they are generated if you lose them
warn if some file is corrupted
warn if you mastered all


internal details:
1.Read configuration file, foreach file
	-check if size have changed if yes then calc new average grade for file
	-calc which file to pick (sum avg, reverse x-sumavg+1, sum again, rand.next(0, sumagain), walk and -, if <=0 then pick)
	-read memory strings and read grades for these memory strings
	-calc which memory string to pick  (sum avg, reverse x-sumavg+1, sum again, rand.next(0, sumagain), walk and -, if <=0 then pick) 
	-display
	-if(grade) then save new grade for file hold up to y in history
	
	
***stats
-display progress bars for each file
-display graph for memory string


At the moment program supports only 1 grade for each memorystring, and 1 avggrade for each file
